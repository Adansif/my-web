                            Hello there! My name is Ad√°n and I'm a junior game dev based on Spain.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since I was a child I liked to surround myself with many things from the technology world such as 
                            computers and robotics. But there were some that got my eye at the very first time I saw them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I guess that's the reason I'm became a game developer, to give back to others the joy and fun I've had (and still have)  
                            playing videogames.
                        </p>
